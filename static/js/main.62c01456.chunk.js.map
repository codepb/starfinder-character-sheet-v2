commands. The undead can be made to follow you or they can be made to remain in place and attack any creature (or a specific kind of creature) entering the area. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed undead can't be animated again. You can create one or more undead creatures with a total CR of no more than (CASTERLEVEL/2). You can only create one type of undead with each casting of this spell. Creating undead requires special materials worth 1000 credits * the total CR of the undead created; these materials are consumed as part of casting the spell. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell however you can control only a number of undead whose total CR is no greater than (CASTERLEVEL). If you exceed this number all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Once released such undead have no particular feelings of loyalty to you and in time they may grow in power beyond the undead you can create. The corpses you use must be as intact as the typical undead of the type you choose to create. For example a skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse (that has bones) or skeleton. A zombie can be created only from a creature with a physical anatomy.\",\r\n    Range: \"Touch\",\r\n    SavingThrow: \"None\",\r\n    School: SpellSchool.Necromancy,\r\n    Source: \"Core Rulebook\",\r\n    PageNumber: \"p.340\",\r\n    SpellResistance: \"No\",\r\n    TargetsEffectArea: \"One or more corpses\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"Arcane Eye\": {\r\n    CastingTime: \"10 minutes\",\r\n    Classes: [{ class: Class.Technomancer, level: 4 }],\r\n    SpellListDescription:\r\n      \"Invisible floating eye moves 30 feet per round and sends you visual information.\",\r\n    Descriptor: [SpellDescriptor.Scrying],\r\n    Duration: \"(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)\",\r\n    Level: 4,\r\n    Description:\r\n      \"You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information.

Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways as a targeted dispel or as a counter. [Targeted Dispel] One creature object or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as that burning wall or the spell that's giving him those duplicates). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed the spell ends. If you don't specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random. If you target a force an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant) you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item's nonmagical physical properties are unchanged; a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast. [Counter] You can use the energy of dispel magic to disrupt the casting of other spells. First select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast dispel magic when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered you cast dispel magic and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat though you might be able to teleport to a planet's surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster you need not attempt a saving throw nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works roll d% and consult Table 10-1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. [Familiarity] Very familiar describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. Studied carefully describes a place you know well either because you can currently physically see it or because you've been there often. Seen casually describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic remote cameras or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can't teleport to an unknown location that you've seen in a holovid). False destination describes a place that doesn't truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table rather than rolling d% since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. {On Target] You appear where you want to be. [Off Target] You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. [Similar Area] You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range the spell simply fails instead. [Mishap] You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 2d10 damage and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls roll 1d20+80. Each time mishap comes up the creatures take more damage and must reroll.

A xenodruid mystic instead uses crystals and incenses worth 30000 credits. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain but it doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the ground. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees but it doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (cold temperate or warm). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM but in general it changes to a similar terrain type or by one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth from a shallow bog to a deep bog and so on). Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change the type of bordering terrain and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis.
