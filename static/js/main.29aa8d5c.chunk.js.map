A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells as detailed in their descriptions can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways as a targeted dispel or as a counter. [Targeted Dispel] One creature object or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as that burning wall or the spell that's giving him those duplicates). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed the spell ends. If you don't specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random. If you target a force an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant) you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item's nonmagical physical properties are unchanged; a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast. [Counter] You can use the energy of dispel magic to disrupt the casting of other spells. First select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast dispel magic when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered you cast dispel magic and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster's spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster's caster level.

[Targeted Dispel] This functions as a targeted dispel magic but you can dispel one spell for every 4 caster levels you have attempting a separate dispel check for each spell. Additionally greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any curse that remove affliction can remove even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC. [Area Dispel] When greater dispel magic is used in this way the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Attempt one dispel check and apply that check to each creature or object in the area as if it were targeted by dispel magic. If you don't specify spells and there is more than one possible spell on the target your targeted dispel attempts to dispel spells at random. Magic items themselves are not affected by an area dispel but additional magical effects on them may be dispelled. For each ongoing spell effect whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell apply the result of the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell apply the result of the dispel check to end the effect but only within the overlapping area. If an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell is in the area apply the result of the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.

It can drag or fly a Small Medium or Large creature at half speed. It can drag or fly smaller creatures at normal speed but it can't move creatures bigger than Large. A healing junkbot can never attack. The junkbot uses your saving throw bonuses if it is the target of a spell or another targeted effect. For purposes of spells and effects that target it the junkbot is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes. You can give new basic commands to your healing junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the bot has succeeded at or failed a skill check as well as when it has been attacked or destroyed but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link. When the healing junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends the electronic equipment you used to create it falls apart into refuse its components and circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable.

The creature should recalculate its ability scores from scratch as a member of its new race (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. For a humanoid creature the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page. For nonhumanoid creatures a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. Elementals outsiders and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. Any creature that can't benefit from the mystic cure spell cannot be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age. The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form including any forms of movement and speeds natural attacks extraordinary abilities and the like but it does not automatically speak the language of the new form it takes.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works roll d% and consult Table 10-1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. [Familiarity] Very familiar describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. Studied carefully describes a place you know well either because you can currently physically see it or because you've been there often. Seen casually describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic remote cameras or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can't teleport to an unknown location that you've seen in a holovid). False destination describes a place that doesn't truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table rather than rolling d% since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. {On Target] You appear where you want to be. [Off Target] You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. [Similar Area] You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range the spell simply fails instead. [Mishap] You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 2d10 damage and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls roll 1d20+80. Each time mishap comes up the creatures take more damage and must reroll.

A xenodruid mystic instead uses crystals and incenses worth 30000 credits. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain but it doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the ground. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees but it doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (cold temperate or warm). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM but in general it changes to a similar terrain type or by one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth from a shallow bog to a deep bog and so on). Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change the type of bordering terrain and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis.

A greater dispel magic specifically targeting the wall of force can dispel it but treat the wall of force's caster level as being 5 higher than the actual caster level. A wall of force can be damaged by spells and attacks as normal but a wall of force has hardness 30 and 300 Hit Points. Disintegrate instantly destroys a wall of force. Breath weapons and spells can't pass through a wall of force in either direction though dimension door teleport and similar effects can bypass the barrier. The wall blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks operate normally through a wall of force.\",\r\n    Range: \"Close\",\r\n    SavingThrow: \"None\",\r\n    School: SpellSchool.Evocation,\r\n    Source: \"Core Rulebook\",\r\n    PageNumber: \"p.384\",\r\n    SpellResistance: \"No\",\r\n    TargetsEffectArea: \"Wall with area up to (CASTERLEVEL) ten-foot squares\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"Wall of Steel\": {\r\n    CastingTime: \"1 standard action\",\r\n    Classes: [{ class: Class.Technomancer, level: 6 }],\r\n    SpellListDescription:\r\n      \"Wall has 45 Hit Points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.\",\r\n    Descriptor: [SpellDescriptor.Creation],\r\n    Duration: \"Instantaneous\",\r\n    Level: 6,\r\n    Description:\r\n      \"You cause a flat vertical steel wall to spring into existence.
